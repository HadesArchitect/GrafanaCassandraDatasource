# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to use changesets

1. When you make changes that should be released, run `yarn changeset`
2. Select the type of change (patch, minor, major)
3. Write a summary of your changes
4. Commit the generated changeset file along with your changes
5. When ready to release, the CI will handle version bumping and publishing

## Pre-push Hook

The project has a pre-push hook that will:
- ✅ Allow pushes when changesets are present
- ⚠️ Ask for confirmation when no changesets are found
- You can choose to proceed without a changeset for non-publishing changes (docs, tests, etc.)

## Change Types

- **Patch**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, internal changes
- **Minor**: New features, enhancements (backwards compatible)
- **Major**: Breaking changes

## Examples

### Adding a new feature:
```bash
yarn changeset
# Select: minor
# Summary: "Add support for prepared statements"
```

### Fixing a bug:
```bash
yarn changeset
# Select: patch  
# Summary: "Fix connection timeout handling"
```

### For changes that don't need publishing:
```bash
yarn changeset --empty
```

### Including GitHub username in changelog:
When creating changesets, you can include your GitHub username in the summary:
```bash
yarn changeset
# Summary: "Add new feature (@your-github-username)"
